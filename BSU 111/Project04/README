# Project #: Reader Of Books

* Author: Gage Coprivnicar
* Class: CS121 Section #007
* Semester: Fall 2020

## Overview

This program is a digital GUI interface of the Library of Books program written previously allowing the user to load different libraries and choose the book they want to read

## Reflection

This was very difficult for me as GUI's are not a strong suit of mine. I ended up working with several students to complete this assignment, each of us taking different approaches to one of several roadblocks and 
sort out what needs to be done. I also utilized the tutoring sessions which were very useful to completing this. It was neat to be able to make a functioning application that I can imagine folks using, but my question 
that remains is how to compile this program into a single installable that can be opened with the click of a desktop icon instead of in the eclipse workspace. Anyhow this assignment did give me an in depth understanding
with Java GUI's because of the struggle of it all. 

One thing I did to overcome the problems I encountered was to create a new class file that would allos the program to use the BookButton. This was not in the assignment parameters but it works and a tutored said that as long as it
works I will likely still get a good grade, possibly some points written off, but I couldn't figure out how to rewrite it to work any other way after spending hours on it, by myself, with friends and with tutors

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac ReaderOfBooks.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java ReaderOfBooks
```

From there you can put in the location of the library you want to load and choose the book you want to read!
