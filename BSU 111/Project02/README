# Project #: JukeboxHero

## Overview

This program allows one to have analyse, search, and generally maintain a music library exported in a csv format. 
By opening the csv file you can search for a song with specific words or letters, see how many different artists there are with different 
albums and so on.

## Reflection

This was a fun project that harkened me back to the days of the iPod, when people had static playlists and you could use the click
wheel to search through your music. I used the delimiters this time and while they gave me some trouble when getting to
the last part of the line, I figured out a work around for that. 

The other functions weren't to difficult in 
execution, but they did require some thought. Tying all the pieces together like this is very fun and has led to me thinking
what other practical projects I could do. I could see creating a GUI for this interface, or creating a CSV file from
an actual folder of songs I have, and so on.


## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac JukeboxHero.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java JukeboxHero
```

From there the interface will guide you through how to use it, including where to add books, what information is needed
and how to print the books so they can be read
