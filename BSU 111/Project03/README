# Project #: Library Of Books

* Author: Gage Coprivnicar
* Class: CS121 Section #007
* Semester: Fall 2020

## Overview

This program allows for the storage and maintence of a digital library via command line.
Given a book title, genre, author, and file location this program can store, the book, and read it back to you if you so desire

## Reflection

I decided to take a bottom up approach to this project, first building the necessary Classes and class functions,
then finally creating the LibraryOfBooks.java file to interact with it. This worked very well for me as I generally
like ensuring that the lower level functions work correctly prior to building the dependencies. There were some difficulties 
for me in this project. One of these struggles was at one point whenever I went to print out the text in the file
it printed out the file location, this was very odd and after banging my head against the wall for a while, I figured out
I had "filename" instead of just "file" so of course it was giving me the file name. What a pain.

Other then that this project was fairly straight forward, I like that it is practical in a sense and could build
very easily to much larger projects, such as actually building a GUI interface for the library.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac LibraryOfBooks.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java LibraryOfBooks
```

From there the interface will guide you through how to use it, including where to add books, what information is needed
and how to print the books so they can be read
