* Author: Gage Coprivnicar

## Overview

This program is a small animation consisting of a turtle-car moving down a road, over a sidewalk. Near the sidewalk there are a few figures, and a cross walk indicator showing when it is safe to cross.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac TrafficAnimation.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java TrafficAnimation

The code will run itself from there, pulling up the animation window
